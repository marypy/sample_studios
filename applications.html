                &bull; Due to the limited resources of our artist-run organisation, we are unfortunately not in a position to visit degree shows outside of Limerick (LSAD) and Cork (CCAD) in order to consider applicants outside of these colleges.  We do however have a number of different membership options for new graduates which you are welcome to apply for at info@sample-studios.com.
