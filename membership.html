            <h3 class="neutral">Volunteering at Sample-Studios</h3>
            <p>
            Sample-Studios is a non-profit artist-led organisation, which was founded by a group of volunteers in 2011. While we strive toward professionalism, our public programmes and day-to-day running of the studios is  very reliant on a dedicated team of volunteers.

We are always looking for like-minded individuals who are passionate about the arts and would like to get involved. While we are not in a position to provide remuneration, we can provide training and experience in a welcoming and creative environment. 

If you would like to find out more about volunteering, an internship or gaining work experience, please contact:
